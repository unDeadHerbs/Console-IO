* Console IO Library

I have long preferred graphics libraries where the program asks the
user for input rather than the user asking the program to respond.  I
have preferred this style both as a user and as a programmer.
However, there is little support for this style of interface.  This
library is meant to mimic the feeling of [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cin][~std::cin~]] and [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cout][~std::cout~]].
Currently the library is wrapping [[https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/][ncurses]] to achieve this, but
hopefully the dependency will be temporary.

** TODOs

   - [ ] flush out the ~udh::console~ class and ~udh::cio~ to match
     [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream][~std::ostream~]] and [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream][~std::istream~]] more closely.

   - [ ] Don't depend on ncurses.

   - [ ] Make the snake test/example more complete.
